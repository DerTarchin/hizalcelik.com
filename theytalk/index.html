            <p class="not-spaced"><em>They Talk</em> is an experimental science fiction short film that attempts to explore and exhibit this concept in multiple dimensions and ideas. We wanted to explore the ways this concept of such an advanced technology could shape the world and people's lives. In this short film, we bring the viewer into the mental conversation between two ordinary people, and their thoughts and feelings about the world as they know it. The short film uses a combination of narration and subtitles to convey conscious and subconscious communication, as well as other technical techniques to experience this concept.</p>

            <h2 class="spaced">Technical Challenges</h2>

            <p>The most difficult part of making this project was figuring out how to convey the concept of simultaneous, near-instantaneous, multi-threaded mental communication using the film medium, and maintaining the balance between art film and watchable content.</p>

            <p class="not-spaced">Because mental communication by definition removes the need to speak, this technically speeds up people's ability to converse, bringing it to a near instant back-and-forth pace between two participants. When you consider the fact that our thoughts are multi-dimensional, meaning one moment might have multiple thoughts at the same time, we knew that this film had to convey at least two levels of communication. We settled on narrating the characters' conscious thoughts and conversations, while using subtitles to simultaneously convey their sub-conscious, "reaction" thoughts. These can include things like involuntary judgements, asides, and impressions.</p>

            <p class="not-spaced">Aside from communication, the film also had a few other technical aspects that we focused on, such as an interest in <a href="#vignettes">injecting a few side stories into the film</a> as "vignettes" of some unrelated lifestyles and characters, the concept of <a href="#intro">near-instant mental "download of information"</a>, <a href="#locs">finding the right locations</a> for all of our scenes, and <a href="#blinks">subconsious flashes</a> of memories or images.</p>

            <blockquote class="col">
                <div class="text">
                    <h3>Visualizing a Conversation</h3>
                    <p>The bulk of the film focuses on the conversation between two ordinary citizens of this advanced society. They converse entirely using conscious and subconscious communication thanks to this advanced technology. We had to <a href="#script">design the script</a> to allow for a multi-level dialogue structure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Conscious thought</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;the main thoughts and conversation, is a narration by the actor.</li>
                        <li><b>Subconscious thought</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;involuntary thoughts, judgements, emotions and impressions, are in the form of subtitles. These often correlate directly with the main dialogue.</li>
                        <li><b>Memories and imagination</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;these are demonstrated using <a href="#blinks">overlayed images that only last a frame or two</a>, which we call "blinks."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This scene was <a class="ps-trigger" data-target="ab5">filmed using three cameras</a>, and every action by the actor (such as where to look, when to touch the coffee, etc) was <a href="https://youtu.be/PuoiMyozX3M?t=423" target="_blank">called out and directed</a> by Adela and myself, which we had <a href="https://youtu.be/PuoiMyozX3M?t=348" target="_blank">planned out earlier</a>. The scene was filmed in the back of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/61c-Cafe-134109396621241/" target="_blank">61C Café</a> in Squirrel Hill.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p id="vignettes">We developed this concept of <b>vignettes</b>, meaning little side-stories, that were meant to be short anecdotes depicting the various applications and effects of this technology and within this world. By interspersing these short stories throughout the main coffee shop scene, they were meant to be a strong story telling piece that both sets exposition, gives a break to the dialogue-intense main scene, and give us the opportunity to use other ideas for stories within this concept we may have also wanted to tell, but couldn't flesh out into a full film.</p>

            <p class="not-spaced">You can view our draft of ideas for vignettes, which include stories depicting corporate world and privacy, bio-hacking risks, conflict and violence, generational and age gaps, and exploring the <a href="#natives">concept of the "Near Natives"</a>. Some of these ideas came to us as we scouted for filming locations, inspiring us and guiding us. For the rest of the vignettes, we scouted for locations specific to our ideas. We <a href="#locs">discovered a lot of cool locations</a>, and sadly were only able to use a few due to our cut-back script.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Challenges Filming the Intro</h3>
                    <p>The introductory scene, which was originally supposed to be the first of 4-5 vignettes but ended up the sole one, was the most technically challenging aspect of the film. In <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/PuoiMyozX3M?t=99">one particular moment</a>, the viewer is taken into a moment in the thoughts of one of the characters as he "syncs" his thoughts with the social media network, then quickly over to another character's thoughts.</p>
                    <p>We tried to visualize how this telepathic "download" of massive amounts of information from the social networks takes place instantly (like a thought that has just occured, or a long lost memory that was just remembered). In order to show this, we slowed the footage down as slow as we could, to take the viewer "into that instant." Then, the most complex part, I wanted to have the shot zoom out from his "head space," pan over and zoom into a new character's "head space" all within that super slow motion moment. I think the effect was achieved successfully, with the help of a <a class="ps-trigger" data-target="cameras2">stabilizer camera mount</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://revisionfx.com/products/twixtor/">Twixtor software</a>.</p>
                    <p>Another (more general) challenge was, of course, that we needed to make sure to develop a clear example of what this futuristic concept was, and how this film would progress, so that the audience isn't confused when the main scene takes place. Introducing the audience to this concept within a few minutes, without much exposition, was difficult and I'm not quite sure it ended up the best it could have been.</p>

            <h2 class="spaced" id="brainstorming">Brainstorming the Concept</h2>

            <p id="planning">We spent weeks brainstorming, researching and discussing this concept of telepathic projection of thoughts for communication and connection purposes, and all the ways such a society might be different from ours. We came up with <a href="futures">a few different "steps" of history</a> for this concept, ranging from now to the far future, and settled on making the film about two people from a time when everyone has been "implanted" with this technology, but it is still new for many people (perhaps only 10-20 years of mainstream adoption of the tech).</p>

            <blockquote>
                <div class="text" id="blinks">
                    <h3>Characters</h3>
                    <p><b>Namo</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;educator and interpreter/guide for Near Natives at the Polytechniq</p>
                    <p><b>Luus</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;researcher working for the Subsupplier</p>
                </div>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This technology allows for instant transfer of thoughts, feelings, images and impressions to those around you, and others around the world (through an infrastructure like "the cloud"). Some immediate side effects from the adoption of the technology are...</p>

            <ul class="not-spaced">
                <li>loss of body language and facial expressions (due to the instantaneous function).</li>
                <li>emotional damage, trauma, mental institutionalization, etc, for early adopters or "sensitive" people (people are exposed to unfiltered nasty or hurtful thoughts of others).</li>
                <li>changes in understandings for basic emotions, such as grief or jealousy (exposed to a more raw, true expression of feelings between people).</li>
                <li>during the transition to a telepathic society, those who weren't implanted yet became more and more a minority, and therefore struggled more and more to talk to people and get things done, like ordering food or travelling.</li>
                <li>the definition of the <em>"Mutes"</em>: those who choose to shut down or remove their implants, rid ability to project thoughts, embracing the inability to communicate with the society around them; "trapped alone in their heads" again. They are an outcast society, and essentially homeless and excluded.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="not-spaced">Not all effects of the technology are negative, though, as it also worked in many ways as intended; society became more transparent, for there was better communication across countries and groups, less misunderstandings (but arguments and disagreements continue, as we naturally will always have our own opinions). People could keep track of their social groups' activities more instantly (like social media), which left more time for activities (as opposed to the number of hours people spend every day on average on their phones today, mindlessly scrolling).</p> 

            <p class="not-spaced" id="natives">Luus and Namo discuss a range of topics including observations and worries about the youth, next generations, and the direction of their society. They bring up the <em>"Near Natives"</em>, which are the next generation that were implanted at birth and grew up without ever knowing non-telepathic communication. This generation do not know language as we know it, so they struggle to formulate sentences and words; they have evolved to communicate solely through impressions and feelings, and can "see"/know concepts even without understanding them at a young age. This is what they call <em>"shortspeak"</em>, a non-linear, structure-less, language-less projection of thoughts, which is even faster than communicating sentences telepathically. This generation has expanded cognitive potential through wider multi-tasking capabilities and fluid communication, but shortspeak has made it more difficult to communicate with older generations.</p> 

            <p class="not-spaced">Luus and Namo wondered and worried what the <em>"posthuman"</em>, or <em>"transhuman"</em> might look like; this is an evolution from Near Natives to a form rejecting all conventional communication and societal structure, with the goal of becoming a new form of humanity with a higher collective mental state. Esoteric cosmology, superconscious state, transcendental consciousness, mind-melding, hive mind; a step away from "the individual" and uniqueness, towards a more homogeneous society, flattened (and shared) intelligence with a more complex structure than a single mind can imagine. Communication and problem solving through simultaneous, multi-threaded cognitive processes. A diverse, self-multiplying global thought database could be implemented, a place to share all mental states of everyone, like the internet but for accessing minds instead of websites.</p>

            <p>We also played a few rounds of impulsive communication to mimic instant telepathic communication of any immediate reactions, responses and feelings. We would say the first thing that came to our mind, trying not to let there be any pause or "empty air." Afterwards, we'd transcribe our dialogue and fill in any subconscious reactions or thoughts we may have had but didn't verbally convey. The experiments were quite fun and revealed some key clues towards the powers and problems of unfiltered communication a society could have with this technology.</p>

            <p>This project was created as a final project for our Experimental Science Fiction studio, organized by Professor <a href="https://suziesilver.com/" target="_blank">Suzie Silver</a> (a sci-fi enthusiast and experimental video artist). The project spanned several months, revolving around <a href="#planning">planning</a>, <a href="#locs">location scouting</a>, <a href="#intro">filming</a>, and <a class="ps-trigger" data-target="editing1">editing</a>. It also involved countless hours of <a href="references">research</a>, <a href="#brainstorming">brainstorming</a> and <a href="#experiments">thought experiments</a> with my partner Adela. We also met with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/awiscomb/">Ph.D. Candidate Avery J. Wiscomb</a>, who has done significant work in the field of telepathy and other futuristic concepts. Ultimately, the project deadline forced us to cut corners in our production plans, particularly in cancelling all but one of our <a href="#vignettes">vignettes</a>.</p>

                We had a few versions of what the time period our film would take place in would be, as outlined <a href="#proposal">in the proposal.</a> They included:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Present</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;A filming of improvised conversation between two actors, discussing a new technology coming out (pre-implementation) and they hypothetical implications of the technology when released to society.</li>
                    <li><b>Near Future</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;A mixed film comprised of a scripted conversation between two people communicating through thought form (post-implementation), and multiple short stories of people already living in this reality (more visual than dialogue-driven). The conversation scenes would focus on considerations and thoughts of the immediate future, hopes and fears of this technology, and show a discrepency between voice-over dialogue and the actual body language of the actors. The short stories would focus on exploring various day-to-day perspectives of those who live with this technology.</li>
                    <li><b>Far Future</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;A scripted conversation between two actors discussing the current world reality: that cultural/national identities are no more, social classes have formed based on thoughts/biases, and a new form of conflict rises.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
